I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. scholar under the supervision of [Dr. Manik Varma](http://manikvarma.org/) and [Dr. Sumeet Agarwal](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~sumeet/) at School of AI, IIT Delhi. My research domain is [Extreme Classification](http://manikvarma.org/downloads/XC/XMLRepository.html), simply put classification on steroids.

Tennis is my first love (yeah, an engineerâ€™s life) and someday soon I will play in professional tournment. I would love to get better at music, but seeing Ph.D. life as of now, it seems like a far fetched dream.
