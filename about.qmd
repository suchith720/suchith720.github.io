I am a 5th-year Ph.D. scholar under the supervision of [Dr. Manik Varma](http://manikvarma.org/) and [Dr. Sumeet Agarwal](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~sumeet/) at School of AI, IIT Delhi. My research domain is [Extreme Classification](http://manikvarma.org/downloads/XC/XMLRepository.html), simply put classification on steroids.

Tennis is my first love—yes, an engineer’s life—and someday I hope to play in professional tournaments. I would also love to grow as a musician, but given the current demands of Ph.D. life, that feels like a far-fetched dream—for now.
