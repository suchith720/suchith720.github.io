Welcome to my website! I’m a PhD scholar currently working on extreme classification, exploring the frontiers of machine learning in pursuit of cutting-edge insights and real-world applications.
In my spare time, I indulge in a variety of hobbies, including painting, tennis, and playing tabla, an Indian percussion instrument that holds a special place in my heart.
Through this website, I hope to share my passions and insights with you, and invite you to join me on a journey of discovery, exploration, and creativity.
Whether you’re interested in the latest trends in machine learning, the beauty of the arts, or the joys of physical activity and music, there’s something for everyone here.
So, come on in, make yourself comfortable, and let’s embark on an dventure together!a
