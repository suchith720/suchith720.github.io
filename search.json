    "text": "Language models have become increasingly popular in recent times. People are using it for various purposes, including information retrieval, language assistance and code generation. These models are very powerful and represent an engineering marvel of the century. We have come a long way from research projects to something that people could use in their daily lives. The basic building blocks and idea behind these models are simple, and with libraries like Pytorch, coding them from scratch would not take much time. It is a straightforward concept that has been scaled to such a massive degree that it performs exceptionally well. In this post, we will go through the steps to building GPT, which is a decoder-only transformer architecture. Throughout this process, we will see that it is not much different from the Bigram language model, with the addition of a few communication and computation layers. While going through this post, you might feel like GPT is based on straightforward ideas that you could have come up with, but it is the result of a decade of rigorous empirical work that has made it a reality.\nPrior to delving into transformer architecture, it would be advantageous to begin with the bigram model and subsequently extend the concept with new architectural techniques.\nThe following code will aid in importing the required modules. We will only be utilizing essential functions from these modules to construct the model from the ground up."

If you want to experience the village vibe in Delhi, a visit to the IARI and ICAR campus is a must. The greenery there is truly amazing, and you wouldn’t believe you’re in a metropolitan city. Not only that, but the variety of plants grown there will enhance your plant identification skills. The beautiful big trees and single-storey houses with vast garden areas will leave you in awe.\nUnfortunately, our first attempt to visit Pusa was unsuccessful as the G20 summit was being held on the same day. But we didn’t give up, and embarked on the 30 km journey again. However, this trip turned out to be a nightmare, with an unexpected heartbreak. It’s ironic that such a beautiful place could also be the setting of a difficult experience. But that’s life, right?

    "text": "“Life is a journey, and if you fall in love with the journey, you will be in love forever.” - Peter Hagerty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to Utopia, a world unlike any other. In Utopia, kindness and caring are the norm, and people go out of their way to help each other. This world is the opposite of Earth, where selfishness and greed often drive people’s actions. In Utopia, people strive for growth and progress, but not at the expense of others. They recognize that working together and supporting each other is the best way to achieve their goals. The people of Utopia are committed to justice and fairness. They have created a society that is built on the principles of equality, freedom, and respect for all individuals. Discrimination and prejudice are unknown here, and everyone is accepted for who they are. In Utopia, there is a strong emphasis on education and personal development. People are encouraged to pursue their passions and interests, and to contribute their unique talents to the betterment of society. Creativity and innovation are valued, and people are always seeking new ways to improve their world. Despite the many challenges that Utopia faces, the people are determined to overcome them. They work together to find solutions to problems, and support each other through difficult times. In Utopia, the well-being of the community is just as important as the well-being of the individual. Utopia is a world where people live in harmony with each other and with the natural world. It is a place where the pursuit of happiness is not just a goal, but a way of life.\n\nI hereby introduce myself as the creator of the world Utopia, a world that embodies the ideals of peace, equality, and prosperity. It is with great pride that I have crafted this world and I remain committed to its continued growth and development. Furthermore, I’m a PhD scholar currently working on extreme classification, exploring the frontiers of machine learning in pursuit of cutting-edge insights and real-world applications. In my spare time, I indulge in a variety of hobbies, including painting, tennis, and playing tabla, an Indian percussion instrument that holds a special place in my heart. Through this website, I hope to share my passions and insights with you, and invite you to join me on a journey of discovery, exploration, and creativity. Whether you’re interested in the latest trends in machine learning, the beauty of the arts, or the joys of physical activity and music, there’s something for everyone here. So, come on in, make yourself comfortable, and let’s embark on an adventure together!"
